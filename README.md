Public Bug Tracker for Dota2

Please submit gameplay bugs for the Dota team to look at here. We'd like to use the "thumbs up" reaction as an upvote to track priority from the community, so to "+1" an issue please add a thumbs up reaction to it.

Remember to be kind to everyone here - we all love the game and we're all trying to make it the best possible.

This is an experiment for the team so please be understanding as we figure out what works and what doesn't with this.

Thank you!
